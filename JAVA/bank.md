1. Define a class Product with members product code, product name and price. 
    Create 3 objects of the product and find the product having the lowest price.

2. Write a menu driven program to perform matrix operations.( Addition, multiplication, transpose)

3. Addition of two complex numbers. 

4. Check whether a matrix is symmetric or not.

5. Create an array and search for a particular item in the array.

6. WAP to perform string manipulation. (lowercase, uppercase, find the length, find the substring,
    find the index of the first occurence of the character in the given string).

7. Create a java program with a class for an employee having attributes: employee_number, employee_name, employee_salary.
    Find the total salary of the employee.

8. Create a class employee having attributes employee_number, employee_name, employee_salary. 
    Read 'n' employee data and serch for an employee using the employee number ( use the concept of array of objects ).
    == Syntax for array of objects ==
            classname objname[] = new classname[n]
            employee obj[] = new employee[n]

WAP to sort Strings (Compare two strings :  compareTwo())

WAP to calculate area of different shapes using overloaded function.

Create a class employee with member emp_name, emp_id, salary, address. Create constructors to initialize the data members.
    create another class teacher that inherit the properties of class employee and contain its own data members: department,
    subjects taught, tr name and constructors to initialize these data members.Include a display method to display
    all the data members.Use array of objects to display details of n teachers.

Create an interface having prototypes of functions: area and perimeter.Create two classes circle and rectangles which 
    implements the above interface.Create a menu driven program to find area and perimeter of object.
